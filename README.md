# Moxy

Moxy is my Final Major Project for the my Digital Media Design degree at Bournemouth University. 

Clip the soft toy onto your bag or clothing and she will use the “Internet of Things” to monitor your activity. When it is sent to the web you will earn “Moxy Points.” These can then be used to play games with Moxy through an online game. Keep her happy by earning points to play with her regularly. Beware, if you don’t keep her entertained she may fall asleep! 

Moxy is built with Photon, a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller, and Johnny Five.io, the Node library that bring robotics to the web.
